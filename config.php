<?php
// basically , in this project , we are not writing all of the codes in only one file because if we will write in one file only , then it will take more time to load, also suppose we to change in one file , then we have to look on the single page which has lots of codes which may confuse us ! therefore , we break the codes in bunch of smalll files, then import them as their neeed. 
// In this config file, we have to write hostname, username, password,and DB name ! 

$HOSTNAME = "localhost";
$USERNAME = "root";	
$PASSWORD = "root";
$DATABASE = "my_db";
